## 1. Phase gates 0–5

A phase starts only when the previous gate passed; after each gate update the `Durum` row in `docs/00-brief.md` (`Faz | Durum | Dosya | Tarih | Not`; Durum ∈ `bekliyor`, `sürüyor`, `tamam`, `istisna`).

**Phase 0 · intake** — `AskUserQuestion`, Turkish. First the precondition, then two or three rounds of ≤ 4 questions:
- Precondition (its own question, before anything else): **theme name** — "Temanın adı ne olsun? (Marka adı olarak logoda, header/footer'da, telif satırında ve iletişim metinlerinde kullanılacak.)" Offer "Benim için 3 isim öner" as an option. From the answer derive: brief title, slug `^[a-z0-9-]+$` (fold İ→i, ı→i, ş→s, ğ→g, ü→u, ö→o, ç→c; spaces → `-`), suggested prefix letter (first letter, unless `get_app_state` shows a collision), plan file `plan-<P>-<slug>.md`, e-mail/domain examples (`destek@<slug>.com.tr`). Confirm the name in the brief; every brand placement on the canvas uses it (`02-contract.md` §11).
- Round 1: (1) inputs — screenshots (each with its viewport width) and/or live URL + paths; (2) sector and three tone adjectives; (3) interpretation strategy (aynı iskelet / yakın klon / serbest yorum) and prefix letter A–Z — check `get_app_state` / root frame names for a collision; (4) reference policy: look-only, no reference images, copy, logo or brand name on the canvas — confirm.
- Round 2: (5) pages in scope — `06-page-coverage.md` defaults pre-ticked (including the Contact page, which the reference often lacks), optional ones offered; (6) locale, currency format (`1.850 TL`), uppercase policy; (7) palette modes — single palette / inverse sections (`mode: dark` on some sections) / full dark; (8) canvas file + devices (default 1440 / 390) and motion appetite (sade / orta / yoğun).
- Round 3b: (10) conditional features (06 §3c, multi-select "Bu mağazada hangileri olacak?"): bildirim (toast) · onay penceresi · adres penceresi · hesap menüsü (header'da açılır) · sadakat programı · çekiliş · marka sayfası · teknik özellik tablosu · kayıtta ek müşteri alanları · blog etiket ve yazar · ürün listesinde sütun seçimi. Record the answers in the brief; only the ticked ones are drawn.
- Round 3: (9) ikas ready-made pages — for each group ask "ikas'ın hazır sayfaları mı, özel tasarım mı?": **üyelik** (LOGIN, REGISTER, FORGOT_PASSWORD, RECOVER_PASSWORD, CUSTOMER_EMAIL_VERIFICATION) and **hesap** (ACCOUNT, orders, order detail, addresses, FAVORITES). Explain the trade-off: hazır = rendered by ikas, no section to design, the port only binds logo/palette/labels with `update_ready_made_page_prop` and enables the group with `enable_ready_made_pages`; özel = designed on the canvas like any section (AuthForms, Account) and ported as code. Record the answer per group in the brief (06 §2a). The Contact page is never ready-made in ikas and is always custom (06 Contact row).
- Gate: `templates/00-brief.md` fully filled (no `…` left), the user says the brief is right; Durum row 0 → `tamam`.

**Phase 1 · analyze** — gate: `lint_plan.py --globals docs/referans/globals.md --components docs/referans/components.md` prints `LINT OK`; every value tagged `[ölçüldü]` or `[tahmini]`; inputs copied to `docs/referans/girdi/` and that folder listed in the project `.gitignore`.

**Phase 2 · plan** — gate: `lint_plan.py docs/pendev/plan-<P>-<slug>.md --globals docs/referans/globals.md` prints `LINT OK (n targets)`; WCAG contrast passes for every text/background pair (contract 2: ERROR); plan §1 (identity) and §6.2 (section list) shown to the user.

**Phase 3 · build** — gate per unit: the unit's CHK lines all `PASS` (or `WARN` allowed by §3), one screenshot taken, one build-log line appended. Phase gate: every unit in plan order (ds → subs → sections → pages → overlays → motion) has a build-log line.

**Phase 4 · verify** — gate: `docs/pendev/verify-report.md` written from `--js all`; every `FAIL` fixed or listed as an exception the user accepted in writing; manual checks (Turkish glyphs, contrast) done.

**Phase 5 · handoff** — gate: `build_manifest.py` exits 0 (no plan section or anim target missing on the canvas); `docs/port/port-manifest.{json,md}` and `globals-runbook.md` written; open questions listed to the user.

## 2. Per-unit build loop

A unit is one root pair (`@desktop` + `@mobile`), one Sub with its state frames, one overlay with its states, or the DS / pages / motion batch.

1. **Read** the unit's block in the plan (§6.0–§6.5) and the tail of `docs/pendev/build-log.md` (resume: re-read listed node ids, `05-pendev-pitfalls.md` §12).
2. **Placeholder:** `FindEmptySpace` in the right band → `Insert` the root with `placeholder: true`, final name and root metadata.
3. **Build** the whole tree in that `execute` (one call per root frame): every node named as in the plan tree, flat metadata, `textClass` on every text, anim ids also in `context`, values only `$variables`. Polish with `Update` in a follow-up call if needed.
4. **Check:** `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/extract_targets.py <plan> --js section:<Key>` → run the printed read-only snippet with `execute`. (DS, Subs, pages: run `--js all` and read the relevant CHK lines.)
5. **Screenshot:** one `TakeScreenshot` of the finished unit (smallest meaningful node).
6. **Fix** every FAIL in place — never delete-and-rebuild; metadata fixes use `05-pendev-pitfalls.md` §2. Re-run step 4.
7. **Parity:** every layer added to `@desktop` (visible or hidden) also exists in `@mobile`, sized for 390; layout-changing states get `@mobile — <state>` frames (06 §3c "Both devices, always").
8. **Close:** `Update(root, {placeholder: false})`, append the build-log line (§6). Next unit.

## 3. CHK table

Emitted by `pendev_checks.js` as `CHK|<id>|PASS|FAIL|WARN|<n>|<detail≤200>`, closed by `SUMMARY|pass=..|fail=..|warn=..`. On a large canvas one `execute` can time out (`InternalError: interrupted`): split the run with `extract_targets.py … --checks <ids>` and run the node-walk checks (`hardcoded,textclass,clip,refassets`) as `--part 1/3`, `2/3`, `3/3`; add the counts. `n` = offending count (or `found/expected`). Contract 1 = legacy gizem canvas (37 variables, no `textClass`); contract 2 = all new projects.

| id | What | Pass rule (contract 2) | Contract 1 behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| `vars` | core variables | `GetVariables()` has all 41 core names; themed ones carry axes `device` and/or `mode` as in `02-contract.md` | expects the 37 gizem names |
| `hardcoded` | raw values | no node under `P/` roots has a literal `#hex` fill/stroke, numeric `fontSize` or literal `fontFamily` (allowlist in `02-contract.md` §3) | same rule |
| `sections` | section frames | every plan §6.2 Section key has `P/Section/<Key>@desktop` and `@mobile`, both `reusable: true` | same |
| `pages` | page composition | every plan §6.3 page exists at both devices; children are only `ref`s to `P/Section/*` of the same device | same |
| `overlays` | overlay frames | every plan overlay × listed state × device has a root `P/Overlay/<Name>@device — <state>` | same |
| `anim` | animation targets | set of ids from `metadata.anim` ∪ `context` regex over Section/Sub components and every Overlay root (a `resolveInstances: true` pass only while ids are missing) equals the plan's id set, both directions | regex `C-[A-Z]{2,}-\d\d` style (prefix-specific), same equality |
| `textclass` | text classification | 0 text nodes without `textClass`; `prop` has `prop`+`propType` (one of the 30); `data` has `source` | `WARN` with the unmarked count (gizem baseline ≈ 350); never FAIL |
| `clip` | clipped content | 0 nodes with `ctx.problems`, excluding descendants of layers named `*mask*`, `*track*`, `marquee`, `ticker`, `*pin*`, `*stage*`, `*curtain*` | same |
| `rootmeta` | root metadata | every `P/` root has `type`=slug, `role`, `ikas` (section/overlay/sub), `device` (section/page/overlay), `variant`=P, `contract`=2 | `contract` key not required |
| `bgprop` | section background prop | every Section root has `prop:"backgroundColor", propType:"COLOR"` | skipped → `WARN` "contract 1" |
| `parity` | desktop/mobile parity | every kebab-case layer name in `@desktop` also exists in `@mobile`, and every `@desktop — <state>` root has its `@mobile — <state>` twin. Exempt: wrappers `*-row`, `*-column`, `*-wrap`, `*-body`, `*-main`; states containing `hover`; the plan's `Yalnız masaüstü katmanlar` / `Yalnız masaüstü durumlar` lines (plandata `desktopOnly` / `desktopOnlyStates`; a listed layer exempts its subtree). Overlays without component roots compare their first common state pair | same |
| `placeholder` | unfinished roots | no `P/` root has `placeholder: true` (during build: only the current unit may) | same |
| `refassets` | reference leakage | no image-fill `url` and no text content contains the reference host or brand name from the brief | same |
| `ds` | design-system frames | `P/DS/{Colors,Typography,Spacing,Icons,Motion,Imagery}` present (6/6) | 5/5, `Imagery` not required |

## 4. Final checklist (plan §9)

Design side — every item maps to a CHK or a manual check:
- [ ] `GetVariables()` contains all plan §3 variables; no hardcoded hex / font size / font family (`vars`, `hardcoded`).
- [ ] Every §6.2 section has reusable `@desktop` and `@mobile` roots (`sections`).
- [ ] Every §6.3 page consists only of Section instances (`pages`); every overlay state exists at both devices (`overlays`).
- [ ] The **union** of `metadata.anim` and the `context` scan (plan §8 step 2) equals the §7 id list exactly (`anim`).
- [ ] Every text layer has `textClass`; `prop` texts carry `prop`+`propType`, `data` texts carry `source` (`textclass`).
- [ ] No clipped-content warning on any frame, masks and tracks excepted (`clip`).
- [ ] Turkish characters (`İ Ş Ğ Ü Ö Ç ı`) render correctly in every chosen font — screenshot of `P/DS/Typography` (manual).
- [ ] No reference images, copy or logo used; no fill URL from the reference host (`refassets` + manual look).
- [ ] `P/DS/Colors` shows the colour-scheme cards and `P/DS/Typography` the ikas text-style table with four breakpoints; `globals.md` §1a, §2a and §4a match them.
- [ ] Desktop/mobile parity (`parity`): every ikas block, account panel and confirmation exists in both device components; every desktop state frame has its mobile twin; intended desktop-only layers are declared in plandata `desktopOnly`.
- [ ] The theme name from the brief sits in every brand placement (`02-contract.md` §11): logo/mark in `P/DS/Icons`, Header and Footer logos, copyright, contact e-mail, legal/e-mail texts. No placeholder brand text (`Marka`, `Logo`, `Brand`) and no other brand name on the canvas.
- [ ] `P/DS/Imagery` exists with the generated photography direction (`ds`).
- [ ] Every text/background pair passes WCAG AA (`02-contract.md` §10; manual on the `P/DS/Colors` pairs).
- [ ] Every Section root carries the `backgroundColor` COLOR prop (`bgprop`); root metadata complete (`rootmeta`).
- [ ] No root left with `placeholder: true` (`placeholder`).

Port side (done later by the port, listed so the handoff carries it): theme globals created and re-listed with `list_theme_globals`; every section passes `check` and `build`; every anim target `done: true`.

## 5. verify-report format

`docs/pendev/verify-report.md` (Turkish; skeleton in `templates/verify-report.md`):
1. Header: date, canvas file, plan path, prefix, contract, `--js all` run date.
2. `## CHK sonuçları` table `| CHK | Sonuç | n | Ayrıntı |` — one row per CHK line, copied verbatim, then the `SUMMARY|…` line quoted.
3. `## Elle kontroller` — Turkish glyph check, contrast pairs, reference look-through: each `geçti` / `kaldı` + note.
4. `## İstisnalar` table `| CHK | Node / kök | Gerekçe | Kullanıcı onayı |` — one line of reasoning each; empty table if none.
5. `## Ekran görüntüleri` — list of screenshots taken (unit, node id, what it shows).
6. `## Sonuç` — one sentence: ready for handoff or not.

## 6. build-log format

`docs/pendev/build-log.md` is append-only and lets a new session resume. Header once:

```
# Build log — <slug> (<P>, contract <n>)

| Kök | Node | CHK | Ekran görüntüsü |
|---|---|---|---|
```

Then one line per finished root frame: `| <root> | <nodeId> | <CHK summary> | <screenshot note> |`, e.g.
`| P/Section/Hero@desktop | 4kT9x | sections PASS · anim 8/8 · textclass 0 · clip 0 | masaüstü hero, başlık maskeleri doğru |`.
Fixes after the fact get a new line with the same root and `düzeltme:` in the note; never edit old lines.

## 7. Options workflow (temp frame → real design)

Use this whenever the user asks for options, alternatives, proposals, motion ideas, or "what else could we do". It applies in every phase, including revisions after verify.

**1. Open the temp frame.**
- Reuse the open temp frame, or create one root frame named `<Konu> önerileri (geçici)`.
- Do not give it the `P/` prefix: CHK ignores it, and nothing in it is a contract node.
- Place it with `FindEmptySpace`, right of the band it concerns. Use `fill: $color-surface`, vertical layout, `gap: 56`, `padding: 64`.

**2. Draw numbered options.** Each option is:
- an `opt-label`, holding an `opt-title` ("N · Ad") and an `opt-desc`. For motion the description gives values, duration and easing, implementation (`css-transition` / `animejs` / `io-hook` …), mobile behaviour and reduced motion; for layout it gives sizes and what changes.
- the option itself: a full-width mock of the block, or a `motion-row` of 2–3 `motion-frame`s. Each motion frame is a `motion-stage` (a scaled replica built from real canvas images) plus a `note` (start → middle → end).
- Start the block with one `opt-label` that says which options can be combined (e.g. one entrance + one hover).

**3. Do not touch the real design while options are open.**
- No plan ids, no anim metadata, no root metadata in the temp frame.
- No reference assets, no eyebrows (rule 11).

**4. Iterate in the temp frame.** When the user asks for more ideas, a change, or a combination ("1 ile 4 bir olsun"), add a new numbered option to the temp frame. Do not edit the real unit.

**5. Transfer only on a pick**, e.g. "N asıl tasarıma aktar", "bunu kullan", "sadece bu olsun":
1. Plan data first: tree, props, anims; a local `<P>-M-NN` recipe for new motion. Then `gen_plan.py` and `lint_plan.py` → `LINT OK`.
2. Canvas: build the option inside the real Section/Sub. Put anim ids in `metadata` at creation, or in `context`. Add a `— <state>` frame if the layout changes.
3. Motion frames: `Move` the option's `motion-frame`s from the temp frame into a new `P/Motion/<recipe> <Section>` root, which carries motion metadata and is placed in the Motion band. Update their notes to the real values. Add a legend note to `P/DS/Motion`.
4. Delete the transferred option's label and row from the temp frame. Leave the other options.
5. Run the unit checks (`--js section:<Key>`), then a full `--js all` when bands moved. Then append to the build-log and verify-report, and update `globals.md` / `components.md`.

**6. Delete the temp frame only when the user says so.** Before `handoff`, ask whether the remaining options should go. Phase 5 does not start while a temp frame still holds undecided options, unless the user lists them as open questions.
