# 08 — Quality

What separates a designed theme from a generated one. Read before writing plan §1 (identity) and before declaring any section done.

## 1. Brief wins

`docs/00-brief.md` overrides every default in this file. If the brief asks for rounded cards, a centred hero or a purple gradient, build it and do not argue; the anti-patterns below are defaults to avoid when nobody asked, not rules against the user.

## 2. Named anti-patterns

| Name | Tell | Instead |
|---|---|---|
| **Card-around-everything** | every block sits in a rounded, padded, shadowed box | let sections sit on the ground; use lines, gutters or full-bleed media to separate |
| **Default chrome** | radius 8–16, soft `0 4px 20px` shadow, 135° two-colour gradient on hero/buttons | radius, shadow and gradient are decisions from `globals.md`; "yok" is a valid answer |
| **Hero + three features** | centred headline, sub-line, two buttons, then three icon cards | a hero built from the brand's material (product, type, motion) and a section order from the brief |
| **Safe fonts** | Inter / Roboto / Open Sans because they are there | pick from the identity: a display face with character + a working UI face + optional mono; Google Fonts with `latin-ext` only |
| **Eyebrow labels** (hard rule, `SKILL.md` rule 11 — not overridable by the reference) | a small mono/uppercase line above a title: `01 / YENİ GELENLER`, `04 / BÜLTEN`, `KOLEKSİYON · 24 ÜRÜN`, `HESAP`, a coordinate over a name | let the heading open the section; carry the technical tone in the heading itself, in meta rows *below* or beside content, or in the signature motion. Do not add `index`/`eyebrow` props to SectionHeading or hero trees |
| **Emoji and doodles** | emoji as icons, hand-drawn squiggles, generic 3D blobs | one icon set (lucide/phosphor) at one size and stroke; logo via `Generate("svg")` |
| **Filler copy** | English or lorem ipsum, "Welcome to our store" | Turkish copy in the brand's voice (§6) |
| **Fake proof** | invented stats ("10k+ happy customers"), testimonials with stock faces, fake press logos | only what the brief supplies; otherwise leave the section out or make it a prop with an empty default |
| **Identical rhythm** | every section = title, subtitle, 4-column grid, same padding | vary density and scale: one full-bleed, one tight list, one oversized type moment |
| **Stock team** | smiling people around a laptop, handshake, office | imagery from the art direction in `P/DS/Imagery` |
| **Purple default** | violet-to-blue gradients, glassmorphism | colours from the reference analysis and the brief |

## 3. Identity = MASTER + per-section overrides

- **MASTER** is plan §1 ("Yön ve kimlik"): one concept word, the palette logic, the three type roles, the image language, the signature motion, and an explicit "differences from the reference" list. Every section inherits it.
- **Overrides** live only in each section's `**Desktop:**` and `**Mobil:**` lines in plan §6.2 (sizes, column split, what is hidden or reordered on mobile). A section never introduces a new colour, font or radius; if it needs one, change the MASTER and the variables.
- Inverted sections (dark palette) are declared once in MASTER and marked per section with `mode: "dark"`.

Example (gizem plan C, condensed):

```
MASTER  Konsept "ŞİFRE": sokak fanzini; kağıt zemin, 2px siyah çizgi, bitişik kartlar (gutter 0),
        dar dev başlık + mono etiketler, tek vurgu turuncu-kırmızı; imza hareket = şifre çözme.
        Ters palet: Manifesto, Footer, MenuOverlay, TickerStrip.
Header  Desktop: iki satır; üstte vurgu zeminli şerit (32), altta 64'lük ana satır.
        Mobil:   şerit aynı; MENU solda, logo ortada, sepet sağda.
```

## 4. Distance from the reference

Set in intake (yorum stratejisi) and stated at the top of plan §1:

| Strategy | Keeps | Changes | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Aynı iskelet, yeni kimlik | grid, section order, motion language | palette, type, imagery, copy | default when the reference structure is good |
| Yakın klon | structure and measurements | imagery, copy, logo, name | warn: risky if the reference is a paid template and the theme will be sold |
| Serbest yorum | quality bar, one or two ideas | section composition, palette, signature motion | most original; needs a strong MASTER |

In every strategy the reference's images, logo, brand name and text are never used; `pendev_checks.js` CHK `refassets` flags fills from the reference host.

## 5. One place to spend boldness

Choose **one** signature and make it unmistakable: a single motion recipe (gizem: scramble text), or an extreme type scale, or one structural idea (adjacent cells with 0 gutter). Everything else stays quiet so the signature reads. Two signatures compete; three are noise. Record the choice in MASTER and in `P/DS/Motion`.

## 6. Turkish copy rules

- Uppercase with the Turkish alphabet: `İ` (not `I`) for `i`, `I` for `ı`: `İNDİRİM`, `KIŞ`, `ÇIKIŞ`. Test `İ Ş Ğ Ü Ö Ç ı` in every font on `P/DS/Typography`; replace a font that drops a glyph.
- Prices: thousands dot, no decimals unless needed, space + `TL`: `1.850 TL`, `850 TL`, `12.499,90 TL`. Old price struck through in `$color-muted`.
- Percent before the number: `%30 İNDİRİM`. Dates: `12 ŞUBAT 2026`, times `20:00`.
- Product names follow the pattern **evocative word + fit/material + garment (or product type)**, in the theme's sector: `GECE OVERSIZE HOODIE — 1.850 TL`, `SİS KARGO PANTOLON — 1.650 TL`. Write 8–12 per theme so grids do not repeat.
- Copy is the brand's voice, short and concrete; buttons are verbs (`SEPETE EKLE`, `HEPSİNİ GÖR`).
- Never reuse the reference's brand name, tagline, product names or any of its text.
- Every visible string is a prop, a data field or code (`02-contract.md` §6); sample copy is only the default value.

## 7. Self-critique gate

Before marking a section (or sub) done in `build-log.md`, take one screenshot and answer all four in the log line. Any "no" → fix first.

1. **Brief:** would the user recognise their brief and MASTER here, without being told which theme it is?
2. **Slop:** does it avoid every anti-pattern in §2 (unless the brief asked for it)?
3. **Rhythm:** is it visibly different in density or scale from the section above and below it?
4. **Real content:** with Turkish copy, real-length product names, prices and both devices, does anything clip, wrap badly or fall back to a default font?
